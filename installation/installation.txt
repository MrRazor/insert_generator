1. Create MySQL 8.0 database using provided SQL (boards-app.sql)
    - MySQL Community 8.0.35 was used during development and testing
2. Download WildFly (https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/) and unpack it
    - Distribution 30.0.1 version was used during development and testing
3. In WildFly folder, run script .\bin\add-user.bat to add management user (keep group option blank)
4. Obtain MySQL JDBC driver (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/), unpack it to get jar file
    - MySQL JDBC driver 8.2.0 is used in Spring Boot application and was used in Wildfly during development and testing
5. Create Datasource
    - Move MySQL JDBC driver JAR file to WildFly folder
    - In WildFly folder, run script .\bin\standalone.bat (to run WildFly server)
    - In new cli (in WildFly folder), run script .\bin\jboss-cli.bat
    - Run these 4 commands one by one in jboss-cli
        - Change name of MySQL JDBC driver JAR file in second command if needed
        - Change connection-url, password, user-name in the last command
    - Commands (use without dash at start of line):
        - connect
        - module add --name=com.mysql --resources=./mysql-connector-j-8.2.0.jar
        - /subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=mysql:add(driver-name="mysql",driver-module-name="com.mysql",driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver)
        - data-source add --jndi-name=java:jboss/datasources/BoardsDS --name=BoardsDS --connection-url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/boards-app --driver-name=mysql --user-name=root --password=password
    - Quit jboss-cli.bat and keep WildFly server (standalone.bat) running
6. Go to WildFly management console (http://localhost:9990) and login with management user
    - In Configuration -> Subsystems -> Datasources & Drivers -> Datasources, you can configure BoardsDS datasource (enable/disable it, configure connection pool etc.)
    - To be able to run Jakarta EE application, it is needed to disable Integrated JASPI. It can be done in Subsystems -> Web -> Application Security Domain -> other
    - After configuration, turn off WildFly server (shutdown stanadalone script)
7. Clone Spring Application (https://github.com/MrRazor/boards-app-spring), and Jakarta EE Application (https://github.com/MrRazor/boards-app-jakarta)
8. Change spring.datasource.username, password, url in Spring Boot Application
9. Build ROOT.war file of application (Spring or Jakarta EE) using maven clean install, and place it in WildFly folder to .\standalone\deployments
10. In WildFly folder, run script .\bin\standalone.bat to run Wildfly
    - Check if application is working: Go to http://localhost:8080, you will see Welcome text of Jakarta EE / Spring Application
